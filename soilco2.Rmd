```

## Marbles Soil CO2 graph

Simple R Markdown example...

```{r soilco2, message=F, warning=F}
library(iGIScData)
library(tidyverse)
summary(soilCO2_97)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r boxplot, message=F, warning=F}
ggplot(soilCO2_97) + geom_boxplot(aes(x=factor(SITE), y=`CO2%`))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
